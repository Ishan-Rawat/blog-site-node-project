STREAMS and BUFFERS

Can't really define what a data stream is in NodeJS so here's an analogy instead:
Suppose we have an empty pool near a large body of water. To fill up the pool we could either:

A. fill up a big tank that is the same capacity as the pool then transport the tank and fill up the pool at 
once using the tank.
OR
B. Create a stream of water from the large water bosy to the pool which transfers water little bit at a time
and allows us to use the pool immediately with whatever little water is in it.

Similarly we use Data streams when we have to read large files. The data is read and transferred little by little using a data stream.
The stream transfers data BUFFERS that are basically small packets of data.

We use a similar system when streaming videos. (observe that the video loads little by little and we don't
have to wait for the whole video to download)
