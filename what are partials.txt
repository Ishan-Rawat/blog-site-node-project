In our current solution all our template files have a lot of common content (for ex., the head and the nav section).
Now suppose we wanted to add a new link in the nav section. To this we would have to modify all the templates we have. This aint good.

So for this, we can create partial template files or partials. These partials would contain the common sections, such as the nav section, and then
they can be imported in all the template files.
Then, whenever we have to change the common sections, we cun just modify the partials.
