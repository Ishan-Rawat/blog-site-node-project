1. GET: requests access of some resource from the server. This can be be an html response or even a json file.
till now we have been handling only get requests.

2. POST: requests to create new data (eg. a new blog)
3. DELETE: requests to delete data (eg. delete a particular blog)
4. PUT: requests to update data (eg. update a blog)

So far we have been sending get requests from the browser and handling them from the server
        ROUTE                             | request type
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. localhost:3000/blogs                   | GET
2. localhost:3000/blogs/create            | GET (gets the form to create a new blog)
3. localhost:3000/blogs                   | POST
                                          |
4. localhost:3000/blogs/:id               | GET (gets a specific blog)
5. localhost:3000/blogs/:id               | DELETE (delete a specific blog)
6. localhost:3000/blogs/:id               | PUT (update a specific blog)


we would go to the number 2 route, fill up the form and press enter. This would send a POST request using
route number 3, which is the same as route 1!
--> We can send different types of requests using the same route.
And those different types of requests can be handled differently on the server.



next up we will see how to get a POST request from our blogs/create page, so read the comments in the 
views/create.ejs file
