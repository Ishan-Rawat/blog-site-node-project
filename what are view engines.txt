In the express app that we created, we are just sending static HTML files back to the browser. Static cuz they dont change and are the same for all users.
What if we want to insert some dynamic content to our responses, like data from a database (which can be like user data for user profiles, data for blog posts, etc.)
For this we use view engines.

View Engines or Template Engines allow us to write html templates in a syntax similar to html and also allow us to insert dynamic content into these templates and serve the resulting html page.

Express allows us to very easily use template/view engines. This happens to be one the pros of express.

There are many view engines available like express handlebars, pug,etc., but here we will use EJS.

STEP 1 of using: run npm install ejs.
then rest of the steps are covered in app.js comments
