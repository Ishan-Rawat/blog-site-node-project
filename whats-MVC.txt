MVC stands for Model View Controller, and its basically just a way of structuring our code and files so that 
they are more modular, reusable and etc.
Its not really necessary to use, but it helps as our project become bigger.

We have already seen Models(they help in interacting with the DB)
Views(they are templates for the html to be sent back to browsers)

What are controllers:

 -------         ------------          ------
 |model|<------->|controller|<-------->|view|
 -------         ------------          ------

They have the job of taking data from models and passing that data into the views.
Now, we have already written this functionality in the handler functions of routes. So what we'll do now
is extract that logic and put it into controller functions and then we'll invoke those functions in the route handlers.

so next up we will create a directory named controllers, and make a file in it called blogControllers.js in it.
